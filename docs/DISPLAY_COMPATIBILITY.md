# Display Compatibility

MiSTerFin writes directly to the standard MiSTer framebuffer (`/dev/fb0`) — it doesn't know or care what's physically connected downstream. Whether it actually shows up correctly depends entirely on **MiSTer's own analog/HDMI output configuration** (`MiSTer.ini`) and the exact chain of cables/adapters between the MiSTer and the display. Most "I can't get it on my CRT" reports come down to an `MiSTer.ini` setting or an unsupported adapter combo, not a MiSTerFin bug.

This doc tracks combos we've actually verified, plus the exact `MiSTer.ini` keys that matter for each. **Confirmed = tested on real hardware by us.** Untested combos aren't necessarily broken — we just haven't verified them yet.

**Quick sanity check before anything else:** whatever input mode you select *on the display itself* (RGB vs Component/YPbPr) has to match `ypbpr` in `MiSTer.ini`. Confirmed on real hardware — RGB ini (`ypbpr=0`) + display set to RGB input = correct picture; same RGB ini + display switched to its Component input = solid pink, nothing usable. This is an easy thing to get out of sync (especially on displays that auto-label inputs or default to component) and looks like a much scarier problem than it is.

## <a id="scart-crt-pal"></a>✅ Confirmed: Analog I/O board (VGA) → SCART → CRT TV (PAL)

**Chain:** MiSTer main board → official MiSTer Analog I/O board (VGA-style DB15 output) → VGA-to-SCART cable → a classic consumer CRT TV, Sony Trinitron, SCART (RGB) input, PAL.

**Audio:** the VGA-to-SCART cable needs a separate 3.5mm jack input (alongside the VGA connector) to carry audio into the SCART's audio pins — video-only VGA-to-SCART cables exist and won't give you sound.

| Connector on MiSTer | Connector on display | Picture |
|---|---|---|
| ![MiSTer Analog I/O board VGA connector](images/scart-mister-connector.jpg) | ![SCART socket on the back of the CRT TV](images/scart-tv-connector.jpg) | ![MiSTerFin displayed correctly on the Sony Trinitron](images/scart-tv-picture.jpg) |

**Relevant `MiSTer.ini` settings:**

```ini
forced_scandoubler=0   ; leave scandoubler as the core/menu default, don't force it
ypbpr=0                ; RGB, not component — this combo is RGB over SCART
composite_sync=1       ; composite sync on the HSync line — what a VGA-to-SCART cable expects
vga_scaler=0           ; VGA port outputs the native/direct signal, not the HDMI scaler's output
```

**Plus this `[Menu]`-scoped override, further down the file — confirmed load-bearing, not optional:**

```ini
[Menu]
vga_scaler=1
video_mode=640,26,60,74,288,0,4,20,12587
```

MiSTerFin (like any MiSTer Script) runs under the "Menu" core context, so this section's `video_mode` is what actually sets the live framebuffer resolution it draws into — confirmed via `fbset -s` on real hardware: **with this section active, `/dev/fb0` is 640x288**; remove/comment it out and the framebuffer falls back to 640x480 instead. We initially assumed this section only affected the HDMI/scaler path and documented it as irrelevant here — that was wrong, verified by directly testing both states on the device. If MiSTerFin looks correctly proportioned on your CRT, this `[Menu]` block (or an equivalent custom video_mode tuned to a similar low interlaced-ish resolution) is very likely why.

`video_mode_pal`/`video_mode_ntsc` (the top-level ones, not `[Menu]`-scoped) are for `vsync_adjust` mode-switching and don't matter for this combo.

**Status:** this is our own daily dev/test setup — confirmed working throughout MiSTerFin's development.

## <a id="component-pro-monitor-pal"></a>✅ Confirmed: Analog I/O board (VGA) → Component (YPbPr) → professional monitor (PAL)

**Chain:** MiSTer main board → official MiSTer Analog I/O board (VGA-style DB15 output) → VGA-to-3xRCA component breakout cable → Sony LMD-1410 (professional LCD monitor), component input, PAL.

**Audio:** the VGA-to-component cable needs its own 3.5mm jack input feeding a separate 2xRCA stereo pair (not part of the 3 component video RCAs) — same idea as the SCART combo, just a stereo RCA pair instead of SCART's built-in audio pins.

| Connector on MiSTer | Connector on display | Picture |
|---|---|---|
| ![MiSTer Analog I/O board VGA connector](images/mister-connector.jpg) | ![Component breakout cable connected to the monitor's BNC inputs](images/tv-connector.jpg) | ![MiSTerFin displayed correctly on the LMD-1410](images/tv-picture.jpg) |

**Relevant `MiSTer.ini` settings:**

```ini
forced_scandoubler=0   ; same as the SCART combo
ypbpr=1                ; component, not RGB
composite_sync=0       ; do NOT force sync onto the HSync line for component — real YPbPr
                        ; expects sync embedded in the Y/luma channel itself. Leaving this at
                        ; the SCART combo's value of 1 (copied over without changing it) was
                        ; the actual bug the first time we tried this: the display synced fine
                        ; (correctly identified the signal as PAL 576i) but rendered everything
                        ; with a strong green cast — a classic symptom of the sync signal
                        ; fighting with the Y channel. composite_sync=0 fixed it completely.
vga_scaler=0            ; same as the SCART combo
```

The same `[Menu]`-scoped override from the SCART combo above (`vga_scaler=1` + the custom `video_mode=640,26,60,74,288,0,4,20,12587` line) applies here too — component output goes through the same Analog I/O board VGA port, same framebuffer resolution story.

**Note:** a *passive* VGA-to-component adapter/cable (no official Analog I/O board) almost certainly won't work at all — see the "does NOT work" entry below. This confirmed combo specifically used the real Analog I/O board, which has the actual DAC hardware to generate true YPbPr levels.

**Status:** confirmed working, including MiSTerFin itself (not just a color-bars-level check) — 2026-07-24.

---

## <a id="component-pro-monitor-ntsc"></a>✅ Confirmed: Analog I/O board (VGA) → Component (YPbPr) → professional monitor (NTSC)

**Chain:** same hardware as the PAL Component combo above (Sony LMD-1410, component input) — this display supports both 525-line (NTSC) and 625-line (PAL) natively — just switched to NTSC.

| Connector on MiSTer | Connector on display | Picture |
|---|---|---|
| ![MiSTer Analog I/O board VGA connector](images/mister-connector.jpg) | ![Component breakout cable connected to the monitor's BNC inputs](images/tv-connector.jpg) | ![MiSTerFin video playing correctly on the LMD-1410, monitor's own OSD confirming COMPONENT / 480/60I](images/component-ntsc-tv-picture.jpg) |

**Relevant `MiSTer.ini` settings — same `ypbpr`/`composite_sync`/`forced_scandoubler`/`vga_scaler` as the PAL Component combo above**, plus a *different* `[Menu]`-scoped override and one extra top-level key:

```ini
menu_pal=0             ; forces the Menu core itself to NTSC-native (60Hz) — required to match
                        ; the [Menu] video_mode below; leaving this at 1 (PAL) left the Menu core
                        ; generating 50Hz-native video while the scaler output timing below was
                        ; ~60Hz, and the mismatch showed up as a stretched/incorrect picture on
                        ; the stock MiSTer OSD menu itself, not just MiSTerFin.
```

```ini
[Menu]
vga_scaler=1
video_mode=640,26,60,74,240,0,4,18,12587
```

`240` active lines (vs PAL's `288`) and the adjusted vertical timing give a real ~15.73kHz/60.05Hz signal — confirmed correct: the display reports "480/60i", the exact same way the PAL combo's display reports "575/50i" for what's actually 288p. That label is expected, not an error.

**`jellyfin.conf`'s 4th line must be `NTSC`** (not `PAL`) to match — MiSTerFin letterboxes/scales video against whichever one you set there, independent of the ini.

**Known minor cosmetic issue, not yet resolved:** the picture sits slightly off-center on this monitor under this NTSC timing (more empty space top/left than bottom/right) — confirmed present on the stock MiSTer OSD menu too, so it isn't a MiSTerFin bug, and PAL is unaffected on the exact same monitor. Likely needs further `video_mode` porch tuning or a monitor-side geometry adjustment. Doesn't affect usability.

**Status:** confirmed working, including full video playback (a real NTSC-specific mplayer scaling bug was found and fixed along the way — see the repo's commit history) — 2026-07-25.

## <a id="multisync-vga-240p"></a>✅ Confirmed: Analog I/O board (VGA) → a real multisync VGA CRT monitor, IBM P76 (240p @ 120Hz)

**This is still 240p** — MiSTerFin can't tell this apart from the NTSC Component combo above (same 640×240 framebuffer), it's just reaching a genuine computer VGA monitor instead of a SCART/component-input CRT TV.

**Chain:** MiSTer main board → official MiSTer Analog I/O board (VGA-style DB15 output) → straight VGA cable → IBM P76 (17" multisync CRT computer monitor).

| Connector on MiSTer | Video playback | Music player |
|---|---|---|
| ![MiSTer Analog I/O board VGA connector](images/vga240p-mister-connector.jpg) | ![MiSTerFin video playing correctly on the IBM P76](images/vga240p-video.jpg) | ![MiSTerFin music player with VU meters on the IBM P76](images/vga240p-music.jpg) |

**Why this needs a different `video_mode` line than the NTSC Component combo:** a genuine multisync *computer* monitor is built for a much higher horizontal sync frequency (commonly ~31.5kHz+) than a 15kHz-range broadcast-video CRT — feeding it the same ~15.7kHz line used for Component/SCART gives "out of scan range", not a picture. The fix (a known trick, not something we invented — see [RetroRGB's writeup](https://retrorgb.com/mister-240p-120hz-on-a-vga-crt-monitor.html)): keep the same 240 *active lines* but double the field rate to 120Hz. Since horizontal frequency = pixel clock ÷ line length, doubling the *effective* rate this way pushes the horizontal frequency up into a real VGA monitor's supported range while the vertical resolution — and everything MiSTerFin actually draws — stays exactly 240p.

**Relevant `MiSTer.ini` settings:**

```ini
forced_scandoubler=0   ; we want genuine 240 lines, not scandoubled up to 480
ypbpr=0                ; RGB
composite_sync=0       ; separate H/V sync, not combined onto HSync — what a real VGA connector expects
menu_pal=0
```

```ini
[Menu]
vga_scaler=1
video_mode=640,240,120
```

That simpler 3-value `video_mode=width,height,Hz` form (rather than the full 9-value custom-timing form used elsewhere in this doc) is a MiSTer shorthand — it computes matching timing automatically. `640,240,120` = 240 active lines, MiSTer picks the rest so the field rate lands at 120Hz.

**Not every multisync VGA monitor will accept this** — it depends on the monitor's actual supported horizontal frequency range. The IBM P76 does; a monitor with a higher minimum horizontal frequency might not.

**`jellyfin.conf`'s 4th line should be `NTSC`** — same reasoning as the Component NTSC combo (this is the same 240p framebuffer).

**Status:** confirmed working, including video and music playback — 2026-07-25.

### <a id="pal-288p-100hz"></a>PAL variant: 288p @ 100Hz

The same trick has a PAL-side equivalent, and it's confirmed working on the same IBM P76 monitor — same cable, same chain, no new photos needed since it looks basically identical to the 240p shots above. This is essentially a clean, native PAL picture — PVM-style — on an ordinary VGA CRT monitor, and with 288 active lines instead of 240 it has a bit more vertical room to work with than the NTSC/240p variant.

The math carries over directly: 288p at 100Hz (PAL's 50Hz field rate, doubled) lands on the same horizontal sync frequency as regular 576p50, which is exactly the range a multisync VGA CRT already has to support — so any monitor that accepts the 240p/120Hz trick above should accept this one too.

**Relevant `MiSTer.ini` settings** (same idea as the 240p block above, PAL-side):

```ini
forced_scandoubler=0
ypbpr=0
composite_sync=0
menu_pal=1
```

```ini
[Menu]
vga_scaler=1
video_mode=640,288,100
```

**`jellyfin.conf`'s 4th line should be `PAL`** — this is the normal 288-line framebuffer, same as the SCART/Component PAL combos above.

**One caveat worth knowing:** at 100Hz, 50fps PAL content can show a faint "double image" effect in fast motion (the same tradeoff the 240p/120Hz trick has with 60fps content at 120Hz, just a bit more noticeable since PAL's native rate is lower) — not something MiSTerFin can do anything about, it's inherent to the doubled-refresh trick itself.

**Status:** confirmed working — 2026-07-26.

## <a id="interlaced-output"></a>True interlaced output (576i/480i) on a CRT TV

Everything above scans out progressively — 288 (PAL) or 240 (NTSC) lines, each drawn every field, which gives the classic scanline look. A CRT TV was actually built for **interlaced** video: two half-line-offset fields alternating, filling all 625/525 raster lines. For film and TV content that's visibly smoother and "fuller" — no scanline gaps, broadcast-style motion — and side by side we found it clearly nicer to watch movies on.

Izzie Walton (@iwalton3) built a **standalone interlaced menu core** that adds this — see the [tracking issue](https://github.com/puddingstudio/MiSTerFin/issues/11) and the [core release](https://github.com/iwalton3/Menu_MiSTer/releases/tag/v0.0.1). Unlike an earlier approach, **this does not touch `Main_MiSTer` or your main `menu.rbf`** — it's a separate core file you drop in a folder of your choice and switch to on demand, so it can't be silently overwritten by `update_all` and there's nothing to back up or restore. MiSTerFin itself needs no configuration changes: it detects the real framebuffer size at startup and adapts its UI, video letterboxing, and on-screen text automatically. Video is genuinely tear-free in this mode too, via a hardware page-flip technique — no FPGA/core changes involved, just how MiSTerFin talks to the display.

**Confirmed working** on the Analog I/O board: **SCART** and **Component (YPbPr)**, both **PAL and NTSC** — 2026-07-28.

### <a id="interlaced-setup"></a>Setup

1. **Download** [`InterlacedMenu.rbf`](https://github.com/iwalton3/Menu_MiSTer/releases/download/v0.0.1/InterlacedMenu.rbf) and put it in any core folder on your SD card — a separate one like `_Unstable` keeps it out of the way of your regular cores.
2. **Copy your current, already-working `MiSTer.ini` to `MiSTer_alt_2.ini`** (same folder, SD card root). This alt-config is what the interlaced core will load — start from a copy of whatever already gives you a correct picture, not a blank file.
3. **Add to `MiSTer_alt_2.ini`, under `[Menu]`** — which lines depend on how your display is connected. Getting this wrong doesn't damage anything, but the wrong combination below gives no picture or a solid pink/magenta tint, so match it to your setup exactly:

   **RGB (SCART):**
   ```ini
   [Menu]
   forced_scandoubler=1
   direct_video=1
   ```

   **Component (YPbPr):**
   ```ini
   [Menu]
   direct_video=1
   ```
   `forced_scandoubler=1` is a SCART/RGB-only setting — adding it here gives **no signal at all** on component. Just as important: don't change `ypbpr`, `composite_sync`, or anything else relative to your already-working config — those must carry over from step 2 unchanged, or the picture comes out pink even with the right two lines above.

4. **Load the core** (navigate to it in the regular MiSTer menu, e.g. inside `_Unstable`), then press **B + D-Pad Up** to switch to the interlaced config. Press **B + D-Pad Right** to switch back to your normal config at any time — this also happens automatically on reboot, so there's nothing to undo if you just want to try it once.

### <a id="hdmi-vga-dac"></a>Direct Video Adapter (HDMI-to-VGA DAC)

**Confirmed by @iwalton3** (not independently verified by us) on the [MiSTer FPGA IO Direct](https://misteraddons.com/products/mister-fpga-io-direct) — an HDMI-to-VGA DAC board — feeding an RGB-modded JVC CRT television. Works in both 240p and the standalone interlaced core's 480i mode. Only RGB video mode has been tested on this adapter; component or other output modes on this DAC remain unconfirmed.

**Note:** the standalone interlaced core needs `forced_scandoubler=1` to double the framebuffer height for true 480i — a SCART/RGB-only setting, which gives no signal at all on a non-RGB path. If your setup can't use `forced_scandoubler=1`, use the replacement `menu.rbf`/`MiSTer` files from the original interlaced-core release instead of the standalone core file; the standalone core should fall back to 240p without it.

**Status:** confirmed by iwalton3, not yet independently verified — 2026-07-30.

### <a id="interlaced-notes"></a>Notes

- Static UI elements (menu text, thin horizontal edges) *may* show slight interline flicker on some displays — it's inherent to interlaced video, not a bug. On other sets (including ours) the UI stays perfectly stable, so it comes down to your specific display. Either way, film/TV content is where this mode shines.
- Progress on getting this upstreamed into the official MiSTer core is tracked in [issue #11](https://github.com/puddingstudio/MiSTerFin/issues/11).

## <a id="hdmi-tv"></a>✅ Confirmed: HDMI → modern TV or capture card (720p)

**Chain:** MiSTer main board HDMI output → a modern flat-panel TV (confirmed on a 4K set), or a Blackmagic Intensity Shuttle capture device. Requires a MiSTerFin build newer than v1.0.0 — older builds crash outright on an HDMI-native framebuffer (issue #19).

**Recommended `MiSTer.ini` settings:**

```ini
video_mode=7           ; 1280x720@50 — matches PAL content's 25fps cadence; use 0 (1280x720@60) in 60Hz land
fb_size=2              ; framebuffer at HALF the output (640x360) — the FPGA scaler upscales to the full
                       ; 720p output in hardware, for free, so video fills the screen at the same CPU cost
                       ; as a CRT setup. Confirmed load-bearing for playback performance.
vga_scaler=0
direct_video=0
forced_scandoubler=0
```

**And no `[Menu]`-scoped `video_mode` override** — that custom modeline is the CRT setups' thing; here the framebuffer should follow the plain HDMI mode.

**What you get:** the whole experience presented as a centered 4:3 box inside the 16:9 frame, black pillars either side — like a 4:3 broadcast. The UI keeps its CRT-tuned chunky look (tall pixels, not a stretched 16:9 spread), video fills the box's full height (widescreen titles letterboxed inside it, exactly like a real 4:3 set), and the picture modes (Zoom 4:3 / Stretch) work. Leave the TV's aspect setting on **16:9/Normal** — the signal is already pillarboxed, a TV-side 4:3 mode would double-process it.

**Without `fb_size=2`** (a full-size 720p/1080p framebuffer) it still works, with a lesser fallback: the UI scales into the same 4:3 box, but video plays in a smaller centered 640x480 window — scaling video across the full canvas in software was measured to outrun the CPU, so it deliberately isn't attempted.

**Capture-card notes (Blackmagic Intensity Shuttle):** these accept broadcast formats only — 720p50/59.94/60, 1080i, 1080p up to 30, NTSC/PAL — and reject VESA-style modes outright, so `video_mode=6` (640x480) gives a black "no input" even though a TV shows it fine. Use 720p (`video_mode=7` or `0`), select the exactly-matching input format in the capture software, and check that the input connector is set to HDMI in Desktop Video Setup (analog is a common default).

**Status:** confirmed on real hardware (4K TV over HDMI, and Blackmagic Intensity Shuttle capture at 720p50) — 2026-08-12.

## <a id="untested-combos"></a>Untested / reported problem combos

*(to fill in as we verify or get reports)*

- Component (YPbPr) via a passive VGA-to-component adapter, i.e. **without** the official Analog I/O board (**likely does NOT work** — these adapters just rewire pins, they don't do the RGB→YPbPr color-space conversion; confirmed this produces "no sync" on at least one display we tried)
- NTSC over SCART/RGB (NTSC is only confirmed over Component so far — see above)
- Direct Video Adapter (HDMI-to-VGA DAC) for **component** output specifically — RGB mode is now confirmed, see "True interlaced output" above
